                   Google was making big moves to build products that
                   enable the future of work. They’re creating a single,
                   deeply integrated, and connected experience between their
                   communication and collaboration brands. The work would transform how teams of all sizes get things done – especially in a hybrid work world.

                   We were chosen to help redesign the product

                   With 3 billion active users and well-known brands like Gmail,
                   Calendar, Docs and Meet, we needed to find a solution that both
                   made sense of the new offer and retained the individual product equity and relationship to Google.
